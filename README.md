    GetYum is a recipe-to-shopping list web application that relies on multiple APIs, a React UI, and Java with MySQL server and database. User accounts are able to create, read, update & delete recipes from our database. They can also interact with their own curated list of favorite recipes. The secondary functionality of the app allows users to interact with a grocery list feature that correlates with the recipes they may be planning to cook by adding, reading, updating and deleting ingredients from their main or independent lists. GetYum includes integration with Spotify so users can log in and stream while they interact with the application.

<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project
<div align='center'>

[![GetYum Screen Shot][product-screenshot]](https://example.com)
</div>

GetYum is a recipe-to-shopping list application that is built on Spoonacular API, Spotify Web API, a React UI, and Java with MySQL server and database, built by our team, React Routers. The goal of GetYum is to create an all-in-one space for browsing, creating, and saving recipes such that you have somewhere to directly create a grocery list that has all the items you need to make your recipes. With GetYum, you'll no longer have to make multiple trips to the grocery store to pick up that one ingredient you missed for your favorite recipe. The Recipe Routers are a team made from members of Dev10's cohort 55. The members of Recipe Routers come from different backgrounds and partook in a fast paced full stack Java training; GetYum is our final capstone for this program.

We continue to build GetYum in an effort to broaden our skillsets and experience as software developers.
